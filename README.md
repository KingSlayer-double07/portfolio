# Favour Akande Portfolio 🚀

## Description
A high-performance, visually immersive portfolio website built to showcase mobile application development expertise. This project features a custom 3D background, smooth scroll transitions, and a modular architecture using native Web Components for clean and maintainable code.

## Usage
The portfolio is designed for an intuitive user experience:

**Navigation**
Use the sticky navigation bar to jump between sections. The navbar tracks your scroll position and highlights the active section automatically.

**Interactivity**
Hover over any project card to trigger a custom-coded 3D tilt effect. The background also responds to mouse movements and touch inputs via a WebGL-powered network animation.

**Contact Form**
The contact section includes a fully validated form. Once submitted, it triggers a custom notification system and sends data via Netlify's form handling service.

## Features
- **Immersive Background**: Utilizes Vanta.net for dynamic, interactive network visualizations that enhance the modern aesthetic.
- **Scroll-Triggered Reveals**: A refined Intersection Observer implementation that handles element transitions as they enter the viewport.
- **Modular Architecture**: The Header and Footer are built using native Web Components, allowing for encapsulated styling and logic.
- **3D Tilt Cards**: Custom JavaScript logic that creates a perspective-shifting effect on project cards without external libraries.
- **Form Management**: Robust client-side validation and asynchronous submission handling for a seamless contact experience.
